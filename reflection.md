## Reflection

This assignment helped me understand how attackers abuse
website cloning techniques and insecure SMB configurations.

The website cloning lab emphasized the importance of user awareness
and anti-phishing defenses.

The Enum4Linux lab showed how simple tools can expose serious
information leaks if SMB is misconfigured.

Both labs reinforced the importance of ethical authorization
and defensive cybersecurity practices.
